# super_market_billing_system
A Python-based Supermarket Billing System that allows for real-time, interactive billing operations. This program is designed to handle multiple items in a single transaction, calculate prices, apply discounts based on specified conditions, and generate a detailed itemized receipt for the customer.

# ðŸ”§ Features
âœ… Real-time Input: Add multiple items interactively during billing.

âœ… Dynamic Pricing: Input quantity and unit price for each item.

âœ… Discount System: Automatically apply discounts based on:

Total purchase amount

Item types or promotional criteria

âœ… Accurate Billing:

Subtotal calculation

Discounts applied

Final total displayed

âœ… Itemized Receipt: Includes each item's name, quantity, unit price, and total cost.

# ðŸ§  How It Works
The system uses:

Loops to accept multiple item entries until billing is complete.

Conditional Statements to apply relevant discounts based on the total bill or specific item conditions.

Formatted Output to display a clear, structured receipt for the customer.

# ðŸ“‹ Sample Workflow
User enters the item name, quantity, and unit price.

The system calculates individual totals and stores the data.

Once billing is done, the system:

Calculates subtotal

Applies any applicable discounts

Displays an itemized bill with final total

# ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Python 3

Standard Input/Output

Built-in data structures (lists, dictionaries)

Control structures (loops, conditionals)

# ðŸ“Œ Use Case
This project is ideal for:

Small shops or kiosks needing a lightweight billing tool

Python learners exploring real-world applications of loops and conditionals

Developers building a foundation for more complex POS (Point-of-Sale) systems
